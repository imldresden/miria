# Welcome to MIRIA #

MIRIA (for Mixed Reality Interaction Analysis) is an Augmented Reality application and toolkit to facilitate the analysis of (spatial) interaction in AR environments. By enabling the visual exploration of such interaction data in the original environment, we hope to support the analysis process. More information about our research on MIRIA and an in-depth discussion of many design decisions can be found in our ACM CHI 2021 paper.

This software is being developed for research use. It may contain bugs, including critical security flaws.
Do not use this software for mission critical purposes and only use it in closed, trusted networks.
